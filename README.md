# SuperQuiz App API - Requests
The SuperQuiz app API provides endpoints to generate, read, update, and delete Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) through HTTP requests. 
This README will guide you on how to send requests to interact with the API.

## Base URL

Before you start sending requests, ensure that the SuperQuiz app server is up and running. The base URL for the API will be the server's address, which could be something like `http://localhost:5000/` if you are running it locally.

## Request Types

The SuperQuiz app API supports four types of HTTP requests:

1. **POST** - Used to generate MCQs based on a URL.
2. **GET** - Used to read (fetch) MCQs with specific criteria.
3. **PUT** - Used to update an existing MCQ.
4. **DELETE** - Used to delete an existing MCQ.

Please note that the request types and endpoints should be used as follows:

- To generate MCQs: Send a POST request to `/generate_mcq`.
- To read MCQs: Send a GET request to `/read`.
- To update an MCQ: Send a PUT request to `/update`.
- To delete an MCQ: Send a DELETE request to `/delete`.
